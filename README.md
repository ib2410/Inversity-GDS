# Inversity-GDS
Github repo for the Inversity challenge involving government services

First prototype :
Has basic navigation , login page and sign up page . The navigation page includes the relevant ideas i needed to improve the quality of navigating the gov.uk page and also has a clear and visible search bar at the top. 

 2nd iteration  
Included a more visually appealing design with latest news and events and has a section for images to relevantly represent what key events are presented on the gov.uk page at the time. I also improved the search bar so it is bold and visible at the top of the website so that the website is more accessible for users 

3rd iteration  
Attempted to make a section for an ai chatbot so a user can receive a more personalised response to their questions and queries however it is not functional since there is just a page with no functional AI 

4th iteration 
Ensured the login and sign up page work a little bit better in the sense that they display the users name to confirm that they have in fact logged in/ signed up  

# User Feedback
Student1: "Ensure the tabs at the centre of the sreen are clickable so that i can find out more information if i am interested"

Student2: "It would be useful if there was similar information accessible as Gov.uk such as driving tests etc.."

# known issues
The chatbot doesnt use AI , it has a iimited number of responses 

The design is not what i pictured since there is a lot of empty spaces and due to a lack of time I couldnt add specific pages for things such as driving license info so my website forwasrds the user to the information that already exist on gov.uk

Claude.ai has limited free daily uses so i couldnt add all the exrta details i wanted such as making the left side panel buttons functional so i stuck to neccessaries.
